# Winter sublimation at the Chhota Shigri Glacier, western Himalaya, India

This repository is the collection of the data and codes used in analysis and generating figures for the paper published in The Cryosphere (TC):

>Mandal, A., Angchuk, T., Azam, M. F., Ramanathan, A., Wagnon, P., Soheb, M., and Singh, C.: An 11-year record of wintertime snow-surface energy balance and sublimation at 4863 m a.s.l. on the Chhota Shigri Glacier moraine (western Himalaya, India), The Cryosphere, 16, 3775–3799, https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-16-3775-2022, 2022.

## Code
Surface energy balance (SEB) calculations were done in `R` and the codes are provided in `SEB_in_R_18 May 2022.R`. Most of the figure were generated in `R`, except few in `Python` using `Jupyter Notebook`. Several `R` and `Python` library/packages (mentioned in the respective scripts) were used to analyse the datasets and generate figures, **BIG THANKS** to those library/package authors. To smoothly reproduce the figures, the required libraries/packages should be installed in the user's `R` or `Python` environment.
