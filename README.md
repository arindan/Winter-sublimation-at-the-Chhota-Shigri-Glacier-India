# Winter sublimation at the Chhota Shigri Glacier, western Himalaya, India

This repository is the collection of the data and codes used in analysis and generating figures for the paper published in The Cryosphere (TC):

>Mandal, A., Angchuk, T., Azam, M. F., Ramanathan, A., Wagnon, P., Soheb, M., and Singh, C.: 11-year record of wintertime snow surface energy balance and sublimation at 4863 m a.s.l. on Chhota Shigri Glacier moraine (western Himalaya, India), The Cryosphere Discuss. [preprint], https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2021-386, in review, 2022.


## Code
Surface energy balance (SEB) calculations were done in `R` and the codes are in `SEB_in_R_18 May 2022.R`. Most of the figure were generated in `R`, except few in `Python` using `Jupyter Notebook`.


## Data
AWS-M (4863 m a.s.l.) data used in this study for 2009-2020 (Dec-Apr for each hydrological year) is provided in an excel file `AWS-M_30-min_DJFMA_2009-2020.xlsx`. 
Data for each figures in the paper are given in `/data` folder, with figure number at the beginning.
